I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Dr. László Szécsi, for all
of our consultations and his guidance ever since I first set my eyes on
implementing physical simulations during the early stages of my BSc studies.

I would like to also thank my parents, family, and friends for supporting me
throughout these years, and inspiring me to pursue my dreams.

My academic journey so far, culminating in this thesis would not have been
possible (or at least, far less fun) without the continuous positive attitude,
help, support, and understanding of my roommates throughout the semesters. Most
notably, thank you Adrián, Dávid, Gyuri, and Lackó, for being on this journey
with me, and helping me develop a great deal professionally as well as
personally.
